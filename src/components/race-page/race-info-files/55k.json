  "courseDescription": "Race start is located at Steelworkers Pavilion (Kellyâ€™s Grove). Runners will start from the pavilion, run 1.42 miles up the road to Cherry Campground where the Left Fork Days Canyon Trailhead is located. Runners will hop on the Left Fork Days Canyon trail and frolic 5.7 miles along that trail until they come to the Kirkman Hollow Trail Head and aid station 1 (approx. mile 7). From the aid station, runners will head back up the same trail and stay on the left side to continue on the Kirkman Hollow trail (2.6 mile section). After 2.6 miles, the Kirkman Hollow Trail merges into Packard Canyon trail. Runners will continue 4.2 miles down Packard Canyon trail until they reach aid station 2 (approx. mile 14). Runners will proceed down canyon on the road for 1.5 miles until they reach the Dry Canyon aid station 3 (approx. mile 15.5). At this point, runners will do a 10 mile out and back (making a U-turn 5 miles up) and re-enter the aid station (to be aid station 4). Runners will continue 1.55 miles down the road until they meet the final aid station (5), Kirkman Hollow. Runners are to stay on the right side of the trail and make their way back to the finish line on the same trail the race started on. Aid station 5 is approx. 7 miles away from the finish line.",
